Once upon a time, in the late 19th century, the seeds of automotive history were sown with the invention of the first practical automobile. This transformative invention was spearheaded by pioneers such as Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler, who independently developed gasoline-powered vehicles in Germany during the 1880s.
In 1886, Karl Benz unveiled his Patent-Motorwagen, widely regarded as the world's first automobile powered by an internal combustion engine. This three-wheeled vehicle marked a revolutionary shift from horse-drawn carriages to self-propelled transportation. Around the same time, Gottlieb Daimler and his collaborator Wilhelm Maybach created a four-wheeled automobile, establishing the foundation for modern car design.
